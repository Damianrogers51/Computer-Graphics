# Computer-Graphics

This is a simple 3D computer graphics program, which allows users to quickly generate OpenGL primatives and position them within a user-defined viewspace. 
This program automates the generation of 3D figures through the utilization of numerous C++ functions, which greatly reduce the amount of code needed to develop 
these simple 3D scenes.

**Technologies used:** C++, OpenGL, GLSL, Git
